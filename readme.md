Three approaches to solve the BipedalWalker-v3

This repository contains three different reinforcement learning algorithms implemented to  solve the BipedalWalker-v3 environment present in the gym framework

#### Evolution approach

---

- In the folder /evolution you will find a jupyer notebook, a .dill file and a .gif.

- The .gif shows our best performing agent using this strategy
- The .dill file contains a saving of this best agent
- The jupyer notebook can be run easily using Colab, or the same requirements as for the lab sessions. Note that you can run by uploading the saved parameters, or you can re run the training. With the parameters in place, it could take quite some time.



#### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)

#### World Models
